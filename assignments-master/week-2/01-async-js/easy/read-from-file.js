//  ## Reading the contents of a file

// Write code to read contents of a file and print it to the console. 
// You can use the fs library to as a black box, the goal is to understand async tasks. 
// Try to do an expensive operation below the file read and see how it affects the output. 
// Make the expensive operation more and more expensive and see how it affects the output. 



const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('1-counter.js', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    console.log("🚀 ~ file: 3-read-from-file.js:13 ~ fs.readFile ~ data:", data);
    console.log("🚀 ~ file: 3-read-from-file.js:13 ~ fs.readFile ~ err:", err);
});
